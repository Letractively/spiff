Changes since 0.2

  * Html2Wiki.py: A broken unit test caused many bugs to remain undiscovered.
  The test was fixed, the linebreak-handling of the class was reworked and some
  other bugs were also fixed. You should particulary notice a much higher
  reliability when converting between wiki markup and HTML multiple times.

Changes since 0.1

  * Wiki2Html.py: Now also works with windows line breaks. Line break handling
  has also bee improved in other cases. The _underline_ tag now underlines, it
  no longer strikes through the text.
  The #Table tag has been removed, tables work now only by using the #Heading
  and #Row tags.
  Headings now support additional characters, like punctuation, slashes,
  dashes, etc.
  (set_wiki_word_handler): New method, provides a hook into the new WikiWord
  parser.
  (set_url_handler): New method, provides a hook into the new URL parser.

  * Html2Wiki.py: Added support for hyperlinks. Changed to reflect the changes
  in Wiki2Html.py.
