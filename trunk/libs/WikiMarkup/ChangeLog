Changes since 0.1

  * Wiki2Html.py: Now also works with windows line breaks. Line break handling
  has also bee improved in other cases. The _underline_ tag now underlines, it
  no longer strikes through the text.
  The #Table tag has been removed, tables work now only by using the #Heading
  and #Row tags.
