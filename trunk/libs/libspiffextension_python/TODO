* The unit test for the Manager class does not yet check whether installation
  works properly. It currently tries to install HelloWorldExtension, which
  triggers a dependency_not_met error, because HelloWorldExtension specifies
  "spiff" and "spoff" as dependencies.
  To test the complete installation process, the dependencies specified by
  HelloWorldExtension need to be made available.
* The test should clean up after itself, removing the installed plugin if the
  installation was unsuccessful. It should also delete the installation
  directory when remove_extension_from_id() is called.
