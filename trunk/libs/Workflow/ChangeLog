	* BranchNode.py, Activities/*.py: Implemented path prediction.

	* Activities/Join.py: Replaces Synchronization and Discriminator, now
	newly supporting: Cancelling Partial Join, Blocking Partial Join,
	Structured Partial Join, Cancelling Discriminator, Blocking Discriminator,
	Generalized AND-Join, and Acyclic Synchronizing Merge.
	* Activities/Synchronization.py: Replaced by Join.
	* Activities/Discriminator.py: Replaced by Join.
	* Activities/*.py: Removed the need to call completed_notify in every
	activity.
	* Activities/AddInstance.py: Removed.
	* Activities/Trigger.py: Replaces AddInstance.py.

	* BranchNode.py: New tree-based model for branches.
	* Branch.py: Removed in favor of BranchNode.py.
	* Activities/*.py: Replace the old Branch handling by the new branch nodes.
	* Condition.py: New.
	* Activities/*Choice.py, Storage/*.py: Use new condition class to replace
	old condition tuples. This allows comparisons to be made against attributes
	as well as (new) static values.
	* tests/*: Vastly improved all tests. Added an xml/patterns/ directory that
	will hold one test for each workflow pattern.
	* *.py: Lots of cleanups.
	* Activities/AddInstance.py: New, in preparation for the "Multiple Instances
	without a Priori Run-Time Knowledge" pattern. This is yet untested because
	there is no trigger activity yet, so the class is not yet useful.

	* Branch.py: Path tracking within branches now works properly.
	* Activities/Synchronization.py: Fixed several bugs with nested
	synchronizations.
	* Activities/*Synchronization.py: Merged the structured synchronization with
	the unstructured one.
	* *.py: Added support for persistence using Python's built in pickle module.
	* *.py: Lots of cleanups.

2007-08-13 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* Activities/MultiInstance.py: Implement support for Multiple Instance patterns.
	* Job.py (execute_all): Now works through the branches in an ordered and
	predictable way. 

2007-08-05 Samuel Abels <http://debain.org>

	* Trackable.py: Got rid of useless signal/event mechanism.
	* Exception.py, Storage/*.py: Use the StorageException class.
	* *.py: Replace many assertions by more meaningful and descriptive
	exceptions.
	* *.py: Minor API documentation improvements.
