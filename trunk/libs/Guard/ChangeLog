Changes since 1.0.1

  * DBReader.py (get_permission_list_from_id): API change, accept
    additional search options. Some API documentation was added.
    (get_permission_list): Likewise.
    Improved unit tests.

  * DB.py (add_resource): Support for adding one resource into
  multiple parent groups was added.
  (__resource_add_n_children): The database structure had to be
  changed (moving n_children from the resource_path table to the
  resource table), so this feature now actually works.
