Installation Instructions
-------------------------

01. Unpack the spiff archive.

02. Copy spiff to your webserver.

    command:

    chmod 777 libs/smarty/templates_c/
  
04. Grant all permissions on data/ to the webserver. See above to find out
    how this is done.

06. Edit spiff/config.inc.php according to your webserver configuration.
   The file should be self explaining.

07. Open spiff/admin/setup.php in your web browser and follow the instructions.
    Make sure that no error message appears.
    !!! WARNING: This step will erase the content of the database that
