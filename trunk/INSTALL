Installation requirements
-------------------------
Your web server will have to support the following:
- WSGI, CGI, or mod_python
- Python 2.3 or better
- MySQL 5 or better


Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1. Unpack the Spiff archive.

2. Copy the contents of the spiff/ directory to your webserver.

3. Grant all permissions on data/ to the webserver.
   This is done by either using your FTP client (refer to the documentation
   of the client in that case), or with shell access by executing the
   following command:

   chmod 777 data/
 
4. Open spiff/installer/ in your web browser and follow the
   instructions. Make sure that no error message appears.
   !!! WARNING: This step will erase the content of the database that
       is specified in the configuration dialog !!!

5. Out of security reasons, make sure to delete the install/ directory
   after the installation is finished!

6. If you encountered any problems or bugs, please report them at
   http://code.google.com/p/spiff/issues/list
   You can also tell us how we can make the installation procedure even
   easier.

7. Done! You should now be able to open the index.py file in your web browser.


Using mod_rewrite
------------------
Spiff supports mod_rewrite. To enable it, follow these instructions:

1. Edit the .htaccess file in the root directory of Spiff and change
   "RewriteEngine off" to "RewriteEngine on"

2. If Spiff is NOT installed in the www root of your webserver (i.e.
   opening "http://www.your-domain-name.com" does not point to your
   Spiff directory), you will have to edit the RewriteRule statements.
   It is expected that you know how to do that if you use mod_rewrite.
