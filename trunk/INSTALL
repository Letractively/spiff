Installation Instructions
-------------------------

01. Unpack the Spiff archive.

02. Copy the contents of the spiff/ directory to your webserver.

03. Grant all permissions on data/ to the webserver.
    This is done by either using your FTP client (refer to the documentation
    of the client in that case), or with shell access by executing the
    following command:

    chmod 777 data/
  
06. Open spiff/installer/install.py in your web browser and follow the
    instructions. Make sure that no error message appears.
    !!! WARNING: This step will erase the content of the database that
        is specified in the configuration dialog !!!

07. If you encountered any problems or bugs, please report them at
    http://code.google.com/p/spiff/issues/list
    You can also tell us how we can make the installation procedure even
    easier.

08. Done! You should now be able to open the index.py file in your web browser.


Using mod_rewrite
------------------

Spiff supports mod_rewrite. To enable it, follow these instructions:

1. Edit the .htaccess file in the root directory of Spiff and change
   "RewriteEngine off" to "RewriteEngine on"

2. If Spiff is NOT installed in the www root of your webserver (i.e.
   opening "http://www.your-domain-name.com" does not point to your
   Spiff directory), you will have to edit the RewriteRule statements.
   It is expected that you know how to do that if you use mod_rewrite.

3. Edit the functions.py file in the root directory of Spiff and change
   "use_mod_rewrite = False" (near the top of the file) to
   "use_mod_rewrite = True".
