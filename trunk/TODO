* Admin Center: Test better whether the permission escalation prevention
  works.

* Implement a Menu extension.

* Decide how to lay out multiple plugins on one site and implement the
  ContentManager extension that does the layout.
  - Create layout containers? (Straight forward, but how can we hide
    complexity in simple cases?)
  - Define fixed locations depending on the plugin? (Unflexible)
  - Let plugins configure this (Non-intuitive? Too complex in complex
    cases?)

* Create a NavigationBar ("breadcrumbs") extension.

* Create an admin GUI for installing extensions.

* Implement a RecentChanges extension.

* Implement a MenuBar extension.


Long Term
----------
* Integrator/Extensions: Get the signal permission checks right.
