* Fix the "number of children" counter behind group names.

* Fix permission editor error message in the "new user" page.

* Fix permission editor error message in the "new group" page.

* Fix: Make users and groups saveable.

* Add resource attribute support to phpacl.

* When the apply button in the editor page is pressed, submit the
  log to the server and execute the actions.

* Delete orphaned users.

* Handle invalid/duplicate user/group names.

* Create use cases for plugins.

* Decide how to lay out multiple plugins on one site.
  - Create layout containers? (Straight forward, but how can we hide
    complexity in simple cases?)
  - Define fixed locations depending on the plugin? (Unflexible)
  - Let plugins configure this (Non-intuitive? Too complex in complex
    cases?)

* Define the plugin API. Stuff that should be easy to do for plugins:
  - Using the authentication framework.
  - Storing configuration and sharing them with other plugins.
    (Should this be done by a simple library that wraps database access?
     Should plugins be responsible to handle this themselves?)
  - Communication with other plugins. (And avoid the problems introduced
    by a synchronous bus.)
  - ...

* Implement login for the admin GUI. This should be done as a plugin!

* I18Nize the admin interface.

* Add a navigation bar ("breadcrumbs") to the admin GUI.

* Create a bus over which plugins are able to communicate. Investigate
  open standard protocols, maybe there is even an implementation
  already.

* Create an admin GUI for content management. Essentially, this GUI
  is our "Plugin Central", where the user can add different plugins
  into his website.
