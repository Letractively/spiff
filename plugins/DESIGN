Use case: Installing a plugin.
-----------------------------
- The user uploads the new plugin through the web interface.
- Spiff installs the plugin into a temporary directory.
- Spiff reads the header of the plugin. The header includes the
  name, system name, version, description, and dependencies.
- Spiff checks the header information and makes sure the dependencies
  are installed.
- If everything is ok, Spiff moves the plugin into the plugin directory.
- Spiff assigns a priority to the plugin, by comparing the dependency
  list with the list of installed plugins.
- Spiff registers the plugin in the database, with the priority appended.


Use case: Login Plugin
----------------------
- The homepage is opened.
- Spiff finds a request in the database to embed a login
  window in the homepage.
- Spiff constructs the dependencies of the Login plugin.

- Spiff constructs the Login plugin.
- The plugin constructor registers a CHECK function that is
  called before any other content is drawn to the web site
  by any plugin.
- The plugin constructor registers a RENDERER function that
  is called when the login form has to be written to the
  page.

- Spiff calls the CHECK function.
- The plugin checks the SESSION variable for the currently
  logged in user.
- If no user is logged in, the plugin just shows an error and
  ends the page rendering process.
- When the content must be rendered, Spiff calls the RENDERER
  function.
- If no user is logged in, the plugin renders the login form
  into the page.
- Spiff proceeds the rendering process as usual.

- A user fills in his username and password, and presses the
  login button.
- The plugin reloads the page with the username and password
  posted, and with the login=1 flag set.
- The CHECK function is called and tries to process the login
  request.
- On success, the plugin sets the SESSION variable and the 
  page rendering process proceeds as usual.


Example Plugin
--------------
class SpiffExtension_Login extends SpiffExtension {
  function initialize(&$spiff) {
    $spiff->register_callback('on_plugin_page_open',      '$this->on_plugin_page_open');
    $spiff->register_callback('on_plugin_render_request', '$this->on_plugin_render_request');
  }

  public function on_plugin_page_open() {
    echo "SpiffExtension_Login::on_plugin_page_open()<br>\n";
  }

  public function on_plugin_render_request() {
    echo "SpiffExtension_Login::on_plugin_render_request()<br>\n";
  }
}
