== Tables ==

A table is a little more sophisticated, but still pretty easy. Note that tables do not require a heading, the #Heading tag is optional.

#Heading
  | 
  | Heading 1
  | Heading /with/ markup
  | Heading 3
#Row
  | #
  | More text 1
  | More text 2
  | More text 3
#Row
  | # ||| This text spans over multiple cells.
#Row
  || And yet more text
  || In multiple columns.

== Links to other pages ==

Link to other pages in the same Wiki: ->Simple or CamelCaseWords
You can also prevent a !WikiWord from being linked.
Link to other pages on your homepage: [admin/users] or [admin/users This is my link!]
Link to external pages: [http://debain.org] or [http://debain.org This is an external link!]

== Preformatted text ==

If you want to show some text that is not modified by the Wiki, you mark it as such. For example:
#Text
== This is not changed into a header ==

You can also embed code and preserve indent:

    def link(self, text):
        text = text[1:-1]
        pos = text.find(' ')
        if pos == -1:
            url     = escape(text)
            caption = url
#End


== Lists ==

A simple numbered list:

# Line 1
# Second one
# Another one.

#Text
# Line 1
# Second one
# Another one.
#End

Unnumbered list:

* Yes yes
* This may work.
* It might also not work.

#Text
* Yes yes
* This may work.
* It might also not work.
#End

As you might have seen in the table example above, you can also use tables as lists. Cells that contain only a hash ("#") are automatically replaced by a counter. For example:

#Row
  | # | Name:         | Samuel
#Row
  | # | Last Name:    | Abels
#Row
  | # | Homepage:     | [http://debain.org]
#Row
  | # | Email:        | Look [http://debain.org/about/ here]

#Text
#Row
  | # | Name:         | Samuel
#Row
  | # | Last Name:    | Abels
#Row
  | # | Homepage:     | [http://debain.org]
#Row
  | # | Email:        | Look [http://debain.org/about/ here]
#End
