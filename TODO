  setup.php.

* Add a navigation bar ("breadcrumbs") to the admin GUI.

* Create a user friendly user admin GUI that correctly reflects
  permission inheritance.

* Implement login for the admin GUI.

* Create a bus over which plugins are able to communicate. Investigate
  open standard protocols, maybe there is even an implementation
  already.

* Create an admin GUI for content management. Essentially, this GUI
  is our "Plugin Central", where the user can add different plugins
  into his website.

* Define the plugin API. Stuff that should be easy to do for plugins:
  - Using the authentication framework.
  - Storing simple type/value pairs.
  - Communication with other plugins.
