    varchar(100) description,
    bool use_group_rights,
    ...
    foreign key(aro_id) REFERENCES aro(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  )

* Create a user friendly user admin GUI that correctly reflects

* Create a bus over which plugins are able to communicate. Investigate

  already.

* Create an admin GUI for content management. Essentially, this GUI
  is our "Plugin Central", where the user can add different plugins
  into his website.

* Define the plugin API. Stuff that should be easy to do for plugins:
  - Using the authentication framework.
  - Storing simple type/value pairs.
  - Communication with other plugins.
  - ...
