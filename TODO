* WikiMarkup: Support preformatted text (e.g. Code)

* Warehouse: Add support for diff.

* WikiPage: Support diffs in the version history.

* RecentChanges: Implement as a new extension.

* Admin Center: Make the "Add membership" button work.

* Admin Center: Make the "Cancel membership" button work; handle
  orphaned users?

* Admin Center: Test better whether the permission escalation prevention
  works.

* Integrator/Extensions: Get the signal permission checks right.

* Create a navigation bar ("breadcrumbs") extension.

* Decide how to lay out multiple plugins on one site.
  - Create layout containers? (Straight forward, but how can we hide
    complexity in simple cases?)
  - Define fixed locations depending on the plugin? (Unflexible)
  - Let plugins configure this (Non-intuitive? Too complex in complex
    cases?)

* Define the plugin API. Stuff that should be easy to do for plugins:
  - Using the authentication framework.
  - Storing configuration and sharing them with other plugins.
    (Should this be done by a simple library that wraps database access?
     Should plugins be responsible to handle this themselves?)
  - Communication with other plugins. (And avoid the problems introduced
    by a synchronous bus.)
  - ...

* Create an admin GUI for content management. Essentially, this GUI
  is our "Plugin Central", where the user can add different plugins
  into his website.
