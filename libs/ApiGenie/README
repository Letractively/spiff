Spiff ApiGenie
--------------
This library is part of the Spiff platform.

Spiff ApiGenie is a library for parsing, editing, and storing inline
API documentation embedded into source code. It can also be used to
convert documentation from one format into another.

ApiGenie works by parsing the documentation into a generic data
model. It then provides methods for editing the documentation, as
well as filters for exporting the model back into the source file.
