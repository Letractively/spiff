Changes since 1.9.0

  

Changes since 1.2.0

  * All-over: Redesigned the entire API, making the library type-aware. This
  also made sections obsolete, and they were removed.
  * DBReader.py, DB.py: Implemented caching for Resource and Action objects.
  * DBReader.py: Added a last_change field to ACLs and added 
  get_last_permission_change() to the API.
  Added new API has_resource().
  * DBReader.py: Added support for boolean attribute types. string attributes
  are now stored in a TEXT field, no longer a VARCHAR, so longer strings are
  supported. More API documentation was added. Using a table name prefix now
  actually works.
  (get_resource_list): New.
  (set_table_prefix): Fixed.
  * DB.py: Added support for boolean attribute types.

Changes since 1.0.1

  * Acl.py (get_inherited)(set_inherited)(set_id)(get_id): New
  methods.
  
  * ResourcePath.py: Added new class for user convenience.

  * DBReader.py (get_resource_parents_from_id): Fixed a bug that the
  result was incorrect when a resource had multiple attributes.
  (get_resource_children_from_id): Likewise.
  (get_resource_path_from_id): New.
  (get_resource_from_name): Fixed (apparently did not work at all).
  (get_permission_list_from_id): Renamed original function
  to (get_permission_list_from_id_with_inheritance) and replaced the old
  function by a new one that does *not* honor inheritance.
  (get_permission_list_from_id_with_inheritance): Renamed from
  get_permission_list_from_id. Accept additional search options. Some
  API documentation was added. Support for the new acl.set_inheritance()
  and acl.set_id() methods was added. Numerous bugs were fixed.
  (get_permission_list_with_inheritance): Renamed from
  (get_permission_list) and improved unit tests. This function is a wrapper
  around (get_permission_list_from_id_with_inheritance), so it is affected
  by the above changes.

  * DB.py (add_resource): Support for adding one resource into
  multiple parent groups was added.
  (__resource_add_n_children): The database structure had to be
  changed (moving n_children from the resource_path table to the
  resource table), so this feature now actually works.
  (delete_permission_from_id): New.
  (delete_resource_from_id): Fix: Decrease child counter of parents when
  deleting.
  (delete_resource_from_handle): Likewise.
  (delete_resource): Likewise.
