* Improve error handling. In the tasks, no longer return a status code,
  instead use exceptions for handling errors.
* Add better support for forms to the Form class, possibly using the
  WikiMarkup library.
* Scrap support for non-web environments and rename "Environment" to
  "XHtmlEnvironment".
* Implement unit tests for Environment and WebEnvironment.
