This one/two/three paragraph has /italic text/ and some *strong* text.
You might also want to _underline_ something. Or /you might add some
marked up text even if *it contains* _other markup_ and spans over
multiple lines/.
/Italic add the beginning of a line/ is also possible.

A table is a little more sophisticated:
#Table
  #Heading
    | Row number
    | Heading 1
    | Heading /with/ markup
    | Heading 3
  #Row
    | #
    | So this is something that goes into the first column.
    | And this is something that goes into the second
      column.
    | Also, this is the last column.
  #Row
    | # ||| This text spans over multiple cells.
  #Row
    | #
    | More text 1
    | More text 2
    | More text 3

Now let's test some form controls:
| {stop-button: Hey, stop that!} | {ok-button: Ok}

Some entry fields:
#Table
  #Row
    | # | Name:         | {login-field}
  #Row
    | # | Password:     | {password-password}
  #Row
    | # | Hidden field: | {anything-variable}
  #Row
    | # | Text area:    | {mytext-textarea}

A simple numbered list:
# Line 1
# Second one
# Another one.

Unnumbered list:
* Yes yes
* This may work.
* It might also not work.
