* Implement route prediction.
* As soon as it is possible to trigger an action twice without
  creating another branch (some kind of asynchronous notification,
  perhaps), make sure to test the generalized AND-join with that
  in xml/patterns/generalized_and_join.xml.
* Make it possible to define workflow attributes in the XML.
* Implement more workflow activities.
